# CSE5819_HandwritingRecognition
Project by: Brendan Barnett and Ashley Jacob

This repository contains our work on a handwriting recognition project for CSE 5819.

All of the notebooks can be found in the Code folder. It is recommended to use Google Colab to run them (especially if training the model).

Some sample images can be found in the TestImages folder. These can be run through the pipeline to see how it performs on different sentences. 

You can also upload your own images and test the model on them.
