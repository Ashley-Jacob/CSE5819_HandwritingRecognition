This folder some test images that you can run through the pipeline. Feel free to use your own if you'd like, though.

Most of these images were created in MS Paint to reduce the risk of noise interference. When creating your own test images, keep in mind that letters must be contiguous and cannot overlap each other. Additionally, the pipeline only supports one line of text. Sentences wrtten on multiple lines will not be predicted in the correct order.

Not all of these images will be read perfectly by the pipeline. You can read our final report to learn more about why that happens.
